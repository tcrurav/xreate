# XREATE digital security training lab

This project is a first draft for a training lab in the XREATE project.

At this moment only the backend is available.

## Getting Started

Clone this respository.

```
git clone https://github.com/tcrurav/xreate.git
```

create a backend/.env file for the backend. This is an example:

```
JWT_SECRET=V3RY#1MP0RT@NT$3CR3T#

MYSQL_DATABASE=db_xreate_dev
MYSQL_USER=root
MYSQL_PASSWORD=sasa
MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=sasa

ADMIN_USER=admin
ADMIN_PASSWORD=sasa

DB_HOST=localhost
PORT=8080

NODE_ENV=development
```

Create the database ```db_xreate_dev``` in your MySQL Server.

Install dependencies and run the backend:

```
cd backend
npm install
node server.js
```

In a new console execute the seeders for the backend:

```
cd backend
npx sequelize-cli db:seed:all
```

Enjoy!
